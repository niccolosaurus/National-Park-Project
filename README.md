### Description

We created this to assist a user in finding National Parks all across the United States and territories. It uses both Google Maps API and the NPS API. You type in the park that you want to find on our first page and then by clicking enter or the search button it will take you to a second page. If there are multiple parks containing the same name it will open up a modal. Click the desired park. You will then be greeted with park info, address, hours, activities and news about the desired park.
